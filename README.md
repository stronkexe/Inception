<h4>Building Docker images from scratch involves creating container images without relying on pre-existing or base images. 
which allows us to gain a comprehensive understanding of Docker's core concepts, image creation process, and how to tailor images to suit various application needs.</h4>

  <h5>1- Understanding Base Images:</h5> <h6>Learning about base images and how they serve as the starting point for creating custom images.</h6>

  <h5>2- Creating Dockerfiles:</h5> <h6>Writing Dockerfiles that define the steps to build the desired environment or application. This includes specifying dependencies, setting up configurations, and executing necessary commands.</h6>

  <h5>3- Layering in Docker:</h5> <h6>Understanding how each instruction in a Dockerfile adds a new layer to the image and optimizing the layering process for efficiency.</h6>

  <h5>4- Image Configuration:</h5> <h6>Configuring and customizing the images to match specific application requirements or development environments.</h6>

  <h5>5- Testing and Validation:</h5> <h6>Testing the created Docker images to ensure they work as intended and fulfill the desired functionality.</h6>
