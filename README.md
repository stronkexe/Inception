Building Docker images from scratch involves creating container images without relying on pre-existing or base images. 
which allows us to gain a comprehensive understanding of Docker's core concepts, image creation process, and how to tailor images to suit various application needs.

  <strong>1- Understanding Base Images:</strong> Learning about base images and how they serve as the starting point for creating custom images.

  <strong>2- Creating Dockerfiles:</strong> Writing Dockerfiles that define the steps to build the desired environment or application. This includes specifying dependencies, setting up configurations, and executing necessary commands.

  <strong>3- Layering in Docker:</strong> Understanding how each instruction in a Dockerfile adds a new layer to the image and optimizing the layering process for efficiency.

  <strong>4- Image Configuration:</strong> Configuring and customizing the images to match specific application requirements or development environments.

  <strong>5- Testing and Validation:</strong> Testing the created Docker images to ensure they work as intended and fulfill the desired functionality.
